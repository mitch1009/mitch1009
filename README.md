## Introduction
Hi there! I'm Mitch Chanza, a software developer with over 7 years of experience in various programming languages and technologies. I'm passionate about open source development and enjoy collaborating with other developers on GitHub.

## Current Projects
I'm currently working on the Atoria CSS framework, an open source project that makes it easy to create beautiful, responsive websites. [You can check out the project page here to learn more](https://atoria.site).

I've used these technologies in various projects, ranging from small websites to large-scale applications. If you'd like to learn more about my experience with a specific technology, feel free to reach out to me!

# Dev Community Blog
I'm currently working on a 7-part blog post series on Dev Community that covers how to create a Node.js, Express, and GraphQL API using Firebase, Prisma, and other tools. Here's the status of each part:

 - [x] Part 1: Setup GraphQL and Firebase Functions
 - [ ] Part 2: Adding Endpoints (Mutations and Queries) for Basic Firebase Firestore/Storage Connection
 - [ ] Part 3: Authentication and Authorization Module using Firebase Admin SDK
 - [ ] Part 4: Extend the API to Use Prisma ORM or any other DB System Apart from Firebase
 - [ ] Part 5: Add Subscriptions and Websockets Support
 - [ ]  Part 6: Add Unit or Automated Testing
 - [ ] Part 7: Deploy the API for Public Access (Monetization and Promotion of the API)
 
I'll update this list as I complete each part, so be sure to check back later for updates!
